\section{Introduction}
This essay extends the investigation of simple harmonic motion by studying the damping force of a damped oscillator submerged in water, aiming to scrutinize the relationship between the mass of the block and the damping ratio. By scrutinizing this relationship, the study aims to offer valuable insights that can inform the design of systems seeking to optimize damping levels for safety-related objectives.


\subsection{The Research Question}
What is the relationship between the mass of a damped spring-block oscillator {23.42g, 35.38g, 52.48g, 69.72g, 93.47g} and the damping ratio?

\subsection{Background Information}
An ideal and rather theoretical spring-mass system oscillates indefinitely, producing an ongoing sine or cosine curve. In reality, there will be a damping force that can be as minimally consequential as air resistance or as observable as viscous drag in a liquid. Anyway, energy is dissipated to the surroundings and hence the amplitude will gradually decrease until the oscillation stops. The extent to which the viscous drag force, modeled by Stoke's law, diminishes the oscillatory motion submerged in water depends on the mass of the oscillator. This investigation delves into the relationship between the independent variable of mass $m$, and the dependent variable of the damping ratio $\zeta$. The mass set used in the system consists of spheres of equal radii but different densities.

Stoke's law determines the drag force acting upon an object traveling through a fluid. It is proportional to the object's velocity and is given by the following per the Physics Data Booklet, in Newtons
$$F_d = 6\pi r \eta v $$
This law holds iff. the object speed is low such that the flow to be \textit{laminar}, and the object is \textit{spherical}.

\begin{assumption}
  \label{as:1}
  The damping force is the viscous drag force.
\end{assumption}

Moreover, the motion of the oscillator is modeled by the following differential equation, with the damping force proportional to velocity \parencite{miller_2004_13}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  m\ddot{x}(t) + b\dot{x}(t) + kx(t) = 0
\end{equation}
The damping ratio $\zeta$ is defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient to the critical damping coefficient --- the damping coefficient when the system returns to equilibrium without completing an oscillation. That is $$\zeta = \frac{b}{c_c} = \frac{b}{2mw_0}$$
where $w_0$ is the natural frequency of the system
\begin{align*}
  w_0            & = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}   \\
  \implies \zeta & = \frac{b}{2\sqrt{mk}}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Hypothesis}

Suppose that the constant of proportionality of the damping force with speed is given by $b = 6\pi r \eta$, per Stoke's law. Then
\begin{align*}
  6\pi r \eta            & = 2\zeta \sqrt{mk}            \\
  9\pi^2 r^2 \eta^2      & = \zeta^2mk                   \\
  \frac{\zeta^2}{m^{-1}} & = \frac{9\pi^2 r^2 \eta^2}{k}
\end{align*}
\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:1}
  For a fixed sphere radius $r$ and viscosity $\eta$, \begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
    \zeta^2 \propto m^{-1}
  \end{equation}
  Equivalently, the graph $\zeta^2/m^{-1}$ is ideally a straight line, although not necessarily passing through the origin, as some form of systematic errors are expected.
\end{proposition}

\cref{prop:1} has a few dependencies that may affect its accuracy. It relies on \cref{as:1}, which, in turn, requires that the flow is laminar. This is a reasonable assumption given that the spheres are relatively small, and the speed is low; the potential for turbulence is insignificant and even if present, the impact is minimal. Furthermore, the buoyancy force on the object
$$F_b = \rho g V$$
is always present but is not modeled in the differential equation at \cref{eq:1}. Notwithstanding, the absence of considerations of buoyancy has negligible impact on precision. The setup involves spheres of radius $2.5\si{\cm}$ and water of density $997\si{\kg\per\m\cubed}$, then
$$F_b \approx 10 \times 1000 \times \frac{4}{3}\pi (2.5\times 10^{-2})^3 < 1\si{\N}$$
\underline{Null hypothesis ($H_0$)}: There is no relationship between the mass and the damping ratio.
\underline{Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)}: There is a relationship between the mass and the damping ratio.

\subsection{Methodology}

\begin{outline}[enumerate]
  \1 Take a piece of metal wire, and cut into segments of $3\si{\cm}$ in length. [\textcolor{orange}{may change to scotch tape}]
  \1 Arrange the masses in increasing order, i.e. $m_1 < m_2 < ... < m_n$, where $n$ is the number of masses in the mass set.
  \1 Fill in the beaker with $A\si{\mL}$ of tap water
  \1 Measure the temperature of the water, and record as $T_0$
  \1 Attach the clamp to the retort stand.
  \1 Lean the ruler vertically against the retort stand.
  \1 Place the beaker directly under the clamp such that the clamp lies at the center of the beaker in bird's eye view.
  \1 For $i$ from 1 to $n$ inclusive, repeat the following
  \2 Take the $i$th mass, $m_i$, and attach its hook to the spring.
  \2 Take a piece of metal wire, wrap it as many times as possible across the diagonal (explanation to be improved), fix and reinforce the connection between the mass and the spring.
  \2 Attach the spring-mass pair to the clamp and let the mass hang freely.
  \2 Adjust the height of the clamp so that the mass is submerged in the water.
  \2 Measure the height of the mass from the surface of the desk, and record as $h_0$
  \2 Adjust the vertical camera position such that it levels with the reading $(h_0 - \dfrac{A_0}{2}) \si{\cm}$ to minimize parallax error of the camera.
  \2 For $j$ from 1 to 3 inclusive, repeat the following
  \3 Pull the mass down by $A_0\,\si{\cm}$ by reading $h_0 - A_0$ from the ruler at eye level. The center of the mass should be the height a which readings are taken.
  \3 Start the camera recording.
  \3 Release the mass.
  \3 Record the clip until the 5th negative peak is reached.
  \3 Save the clip as \verb|Mass_i_Trial_j.mp4|
  \3 Open the clip in a video viewer.
  \3 Identify the first 3 negative peaks, one in each cycle.
  \3 Record the respective heights above the desk as $\{h_k\}^{5}_{k=1}$.
  \3 Then the corresponding peak amplitudes are $A_k = h_0 - h_{k}$
  \2 Take the average values across the three trials for each peak amplitude.
\end{outline}

\subsection{Preliminary Trials}

Preliminary trials were conducted to identify and resolve potential challenges, as well as to refine the experimental conditions. Initially, segments of metal wire were used to attach the masses to the spring, but this approach led to inconsistent wrapping and slipping. To improve the attachment's security and uniformity, Scotch tape was tested and found to be more effective, significantly reducing variability and enhancing setup repeatability. Precise measurement of the initial height ($h_0$) and consistent displacement of the mass by $A_0,\si{\cm}$ were also challenging. Aligning the ruler vertically against the retort stand and centering the mass over the beaker proved crucial for accuracy. Adjustments to the clamp and careful ruler leveling minimized parallax error, further reduced by positioning the camera at eye level.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Raw Data}

\subsubsection{Qualitative Data}
During the entire experiment, there is no spillage of water, which means that the volume is kept constant. Moreover, the spring is always able to return to its original length without any permanent deformation, indicating that the spring is not stretched beyond its elastic limit and that Hooke's Law applies throughout.

\subsubsection{Quantitative Data}

Let $m$ denote the mass of a bob, and $A_n$ denote the $n$-th peak height.

\subsubsection{Transformation}

Using the \textit{logarithmic decrement} method per \Citeauthor{inman_2008_engineering} (\citeyear{inman_2008_engineering})
$$\delta = \ln\paren{\frac{A_n}{A_{n+1}}} \text{ and } \delta = \frac{2\pi \zeta}{\sqrt{1 - \zeta^2}}$$ where $A_n$ and $A_{n + 1}$ denote any pair of consecutive peaks' heights.

\noindent It then follows that
\begin{align*}
  \delta^2                   & = \frac{4\pi^2 \zeta^2}{1 - \zeta^2}      \\
  \delta^2 - \delta^2\zeta^2 & = 4\pi^2\zeta^2                           \\
  \delta^2                   & = \zeta^2\paren{4\pi^2 + \delta^2}        \\
  \zeta                      & = \frac{\delta}{\sqrt{4\pi^2 + \delta^2}}
\end{align*}

This step is encapsulated in the following Python snippet that belongs to an overall script for processing the data and generating the graph.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Analysis}

Let $\Delta x$ denote the absolute uncertainty of $x$. For $\Delta x \ll x$, the uncertainty of $f(x)$ is given by the following \parencite{vacher_2001_the}
$$\Delta f(x) \approx \diff{f(x)}{x}\cdot \Delta x$$Let $i$, $j$ such that $i < j$ denote the indices of any two peaks, and also let $\gamma = \dfrac{A_i}{A_{i+1}}$, the following table summarizes the uncertainties involved in the calculation of the damping ratio from a pair of peaks indexed with $(i, j)$.
